            <p>Here we are back with another post, but this one is a little different than usual. Instead of looking at responses from you guys, I'm going to be giving my own opinion on one of these questions, just to switch things up a bit. I'm going to discuss whether taking a life is ever justified and under which circumstances it woulod be. So I actually think this question had kind of multiple sides, right? </p>
    
              <h3>Legalities and Rules in Society</h3>
              <p>I could say that it's never okay, no one is ever justified in taking a life because who would be in charge of making that kind of decision? In most societies there's a legal system in place, people who make laws, those who enforce them, those who study those laws for great portions of their life. There's a significant amount of thought that goes into the rules of a society, but how does that compare to a human life? Are we justified in deciding as a collective to take an individual's life because those rules were broken? That's also an interesting question because there are rules that govern some pretty serious, violent and disturbing acts. Whether you think people have free will or not, there's no arguing that we all have the *physical* capability of hurting each other and there are people right now who are making the decision to do that. I mean, who hasn't been affected, either directly or indirectly, by an act of violence?</p>
                
              <p>But that leads us back to an earlier question. Is it okay to take a life over breaking a rule in society? Back in the day, and you can still find examples of this now, there were a lot of societies that functioned from the mindset of an eye for an eye, and I can definitely understand where those people were coming from. If someone stole some of your food, I think it's understandable that you would want to steal some of theirs. However, as we advance as a society, we're beginning to understand the importance of rehabilitation and instead of killing or cruelly punishing someone, even when that person commits unspeakable crimes. And I can also understand that argument, because if we could work with someone and teach them how to be a functional member of society, that can have incredibly positive, long-lasting effects. Which do you choose?</p>
              
              <h3>Suffering and Pain</h3>
              <p>Turning to a different aspect of this question, there's the issue of someone being in a lot of pain, or dealing with a terminal illness. I recently seen a documentary called *End Game* by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman and it did a great job of illustrating, without words, the moral complications of having to make a decision to intentionally end someone's life. This is different from suicide, obviously, and sometimes these people are in such an advanced state in their disease that they can't make that decision themselves. If your friend, family member, or significant other was on their deathbed, what do you do? Is it still morally incorrect to make the decision to put them out of pain? It's the same issue with animals, those who are in extreme and chronic pain and truly won't get better. Is it okay to euthanize an animal in that situation. Of course many people believe that it's not and that's alright, it's difficult to imagine anything, even something like pain and suffering, outweighing the value of life.</p>
              
              <p>What do you value and why? After much thought, I still don't know what i believe. This is a question that really makes you wonder, what's most important to you?</p>

Let's discuss the human condition and what it means to be right here, right now, in a world so large we're still discovering it. I love discussions about the big and small questions in life, long walks on the beach and I lose my keys about once a day.</p>
