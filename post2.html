            <p>This time, we're going to take a look at what our peers have to say about the most beneficial and destructive emotions. It can be hard to categorize these things but by putting something so integral to daily life under the scrutiny of a few minutes of thought, we might reveal something about ourselves. Behind every thought, every action and every event in life, there is a driving emotion. But how do we categorize those into beneficial and destructive? How do we find the extremes? </p>
            <div class="underline"></div>

              <h2><strong>What do you think is the most beneficial emotion? How about the most destructive?</strong></h2>
              
              <h3>Anger</h3>
              <p>I believe anger is both the most beneficial and most destructive emotion. At its best, it's fuel and a warning. It alerts you to injustice and broken boundaries and fuels you to fight back and create change. It's a force that propels people. At its worst, it leads people to turn it inward and attack themselves instead of the cause of their anger. They tear themselves apart and break things they hold dear, perhaps from an inability to direct their emotions outward. Even if it's directed outwards, anger must be wielded as a controlled weapon or else it wreaks havoc. Undirected, anger is a strong destructive force that can cause both physical and mental/emotional damage; directed, it's a force for change and evolution.</p>

              <h3>Compassion, Fear</h3>
              <p>I think the most beneficial emotion is compassion. Our world — specifically America — is controlled largely by greed and a lust for economic success. It makes sense because naturally we are selfish and want a good life for ourselves and for our children. However, I think our capitalistic society has put too much of an emphasis on economic prosperity to the point where we have people with enough money to end world hunger, yet we lack the compassion to actually do so.</p>
                
              <h3>Fear</h3>
              <p>I think fear is actually the most beneficial and destructive. Fear is a great teacher, obviously it teaches you what to stay away from, but if you can study it and learn from it. You will understand it and grow from it. It teaches you to see things in a different light and to approach things in different aspects. Not one road leads to the end, but many. Also the most destructive because it will eat you alive. </p>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              
              <p>This is, as with everything else here, an admittedly difficult question. Attempting to describe any emotion as the most anything is difficult, they all feel so real and strong when we feel them. What can you compare that to, and how do you compare emotions like love and euphoria? Is rage or hatred more destructive? Is it more beneficial to be proud or to be satisfied? What about grey areas like indifference and apathy, are they really as neutral as they seem? There are so many emotions and we all feel these so strongly. However, I think the mention of fear is an interesting example of how strong that particular emotion is. Fear and love. If we fear to love do we love to fear?</p>

I currently work for myself making logos and helping small buisnesses with their graphic design needs. Let's discuss the human condition and what it means to be right here, right now, in a world so large we're still discovering it. I love discussions about the big and small questions in life, long walks on the beach and I lose my keys about once a day.</p>
