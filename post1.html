          <article>
            <p>So when brainstorming for this project, I didn't have any great ideas at first, thought is a process and mine was moving slowly. A lot of blogs entail someone having a lot of knowledge about something and wanting to share it, or someone having a complex and particular opinion on a topic. There are countless blogs for food, fashion, travel, people giving reviews or telling a great story. I felt like I didn't fit into any of that, because my life is so varied and non-particular that there isn't enough of one experience to focus on.</p>

            <p>So instead of looking to myself, I turned outward for inspiration and that's when this idea was born. Everyone at one point or another has deep and complicated thoughts and questions about what it means to be human, what it means to exist in this world, or what it means to exist at all. However these are often questions that we find a lack of space for, not truly letting these thoughts surface. Let this be that space. </p>
            <div class="underline"></div>

            <p><strong>Is justice a human construct or is it independent of humans?</strong></p>
            <p>It's definitely a human construct. Imagine a single human on a deserted island- would this human have laws? Perhaps at first they would follow the laws of their former society, but they would break down once it's realized that there is no external enforcement of these laws. Right and wrong become subjective terms, defined by survival and self-interest. Eventually, the only rules remaining are those deemed essential to the lone person's functioning, and in isolation no external justice can be brought for rule violations. The only punishments are self-assigned penalties for breaking one's own moral code. The question now is whether self-imposed penalties and restrictions merit justice, and I would argue they do not because of their subjectivity. Someone may punish themselves for NOT murdering someone- is this justice? What if they punished themselves for something minor and socially irrelevant? Whether these punishments are just is defined by the society an individual exists in, and by the norms, morals, and customs of that population.</p>

            <p><strong>How do you define consciousness? Do you think it's possible to prove that other people besides yourself have consciousness? How do you find truth in this world?</strong></p>
            <p>Consciousness is the observer. Notice your thoughts; then notice yourself noticing your thoughts. The thing doing this noticing is what consciousness is- an impartial bystander looking on at the content generated by the mind. Consciousness itself does not think or do. It merely observes and exists. As for whether others are conscious, I do not think it can be objectively proven. We can subjectively guess by noting their reported experiences and behaviors, but we cannot see an internal observer and thus cannot objectively prove others are also conscious. As for finding truth, I believe that all truths (those that are not physical laws inherent to our existence) are relative and subjective. Situations alter reality, and reality alters truth. What is real and true in one situation is a figment and a lie in another. Everything is so relative that it is difficult to determine what is objective truth and what is situational truth.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Do you judge people by their intentions or by their actions?</strong></p>
            <p>A little of both, though I tend to prioritize intentions. What a person hopes to accomplish is usually more important than how they got there. The exception is if their actions involved causing unnecessary suffering, at which point their intentions may be called into question anyway. If someone wants to help humanity and goes about it via a killing spree, is their intention actually to "help" in the conventional sense? What is their true intention if you peel away deceptive language?</p>
              
              <p><strong>Is taking a life ever justified? If so, where is the line?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes; since I am sure others have covered the topic of murder in some detail, I'd like to bring up the concept of mercy killing. If someone is in extreme pain and cannot survive, or is otherwise certain to painfully meet their end, it may be more morally correct to prevent or relieve their suffering by ending their life prematurely. Take euthanasia in veterinary as an example; if your dog is in terrible pain, it is generally regarded as kinder and more morally correct to end the dog's life in a controlled and gentle way. "Do no harm" is perhaps not the best oath for a medical professional; "minimize harm" may be more accurate, as sometimes harm must be done to relieve suffering.</p>

              <p><strong>If freedom is simply being able to do what you want, are animals freer than humans?</strong></p>
            <p>No. As humans and under this definition of freedom, we are bound by society and by physical constraints. Animals are bound by nature and their niche in the ecosystem. Should they step outside of these natural boundaries they are penalized, hurt in some way for deviating from their nature-defined role. Some deviation is acceptable, as can be said for humanity; total deviation from norms is heavily penalized. Humans, meanwhile, are growing in their abilities to sidestep these natural boundaries via technology, increasing their freedom. Animals do not have this level of technology and are thus still constrained.</p>

              <p>That wraps up this interview, and lets take a moment to appreciate these really well-thought out responses, I especially love the idea of technology adding to our freedom and the definition of consciousness that was provided. Do you agree? Do you disagree? What do <em>you</em> believe and why?</p>

I currently work for myself making logos and helping small buisnesses with their graphic design needs. Let's discuss the human condition and what it means to be right here, right now, in a world so large we're still discovering it. I love discussions about the big and small questions in life, long walks on the beach and I lose my keys about once a day.</p>
