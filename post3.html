            <p>Welcome back to another search for truth. This time we're looking at some complex answers to tough questions on truth, justice, and the value of a life. I am always interested in finding where people stand on questions like these, but why? I mean, what does it really matter if someone would or wouldn't kill a deer, does that even affect how they function in a human society? Why do I care if you think we can fathom infinity or if you think we can't dream that big?</p>
            
            <p>I'm sure you have your own answers to these questions, but here are mine. Of course, we don't ever <em>have</em> to answer questions like this, and they don't usually have an effect on our survival. But just like the consciousness question implies, we're all sort of stuck in our own heads, limited by the boundaries of our own dreams, thoughts, and ideas. So that makes me think, is there anyone else out there that thinks the way I do? Does anyone else have the same answers to these questions? Does anyone have a different answer? Why? Keep that in mind while you take this post in.</p>

              <h3>How do you find truth in this world?</h3>
              <p>I'm 52 years old, so I am not saying this out of any sort of edgyness or flex. I really haven't found any evidence of universal truth. Grey area abounds, and if it doesn't occur naturally, we can always conjure it up in a jiffy. I absolutely believe that we should all be nicer to each other, but it seems unlikely we will ever convince some people of that fact.</p>

              <h3>Is justice a human construct or is it independent of humans?</h3>
              <p>Justice is, without a doubt, a human construct. As with my answer to the truth question, there is no "fairness" in the world. No one deserves anything, good or bad. Life is just stuff happening to you, and you reacting to it. Think of an eagle who dives down and grabs a fish that's too heavy to lift, yet his claws are stuck in the fish. Is it fair that his life should end when that fish drowns him? And if he escapes, is it fair that the fish will now probably succumb slowly to his injuries, because he was a bit too close to the surface for a moment?</p>
                
              <h3>Do you think animals are self-aware? If they were would that change how you feel about them?</h3>
              <p>To some degree, I think most creatures have a sense of self preservation, which means they must have some sense of self. But the level of awareness, or sentience varies greatly by species. Certainly dolphins, Apes and the like are far more self aware than goldfish. And no, it has not really changed my feelings for them. I generally like animals, though I have no problem eating some of them. I do wish something would be done about the horrible conditions most of our food supply endures though.</p>
              
              <h3>Is taking a life ever justified? If so, where is the line?</h3>
              <p>Absolutely. I would kill without hesitation to protect my family, and I would be disappointed if it kept me from sleeping. I have killed fish, cows, sheep, and deer for food, and if I were attacked by any animal, even a pet, I would kill it if I couldn't subdue it. I'm also the type who escorts spiders and most other non nusiance critters outside insted of killing them. So I guess the line for me is to save or extend (food) a life.</p>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              
              <p>Admittedly, I haven't come up with answers to many of these questions myself, so as I read these responses it often shapes my own ideas. So I really liked his idea of there not being any universal truth, because when you think about all there is in the universe and all there is that we don't know, it's difficult to imagine that there's any one universal truth. And even though the question was on how one finds truth, how can you find something that you don't believe is there at all? It's sort of a mind-blowing change in how we think about the world. Because what if our truth, the one we live and abide by, isn't the only one?</p>
